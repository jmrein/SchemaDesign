This is **nowhere near** being production-ready software.

1. Start by making an XML representation of a database schema.
2. Open it, and you can move the tables around for easy viewing.
3. Every time you edit it, it re-saves that schema with updated x&y positions. 
Plus a SQLite script for creating the database, and an image of the database design, in the same directory.
